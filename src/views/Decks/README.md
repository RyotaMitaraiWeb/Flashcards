# Deck pages

## All
This page displays a catalogue of all non-deleted decks in the application. Each entry contains the deck's title, description, creation date, last update date if it has ever been updated, and a link to the deck's details page.

Users can sort the results by the provided options. They can also use the page buttons at the bottom of the page to show next/previous results. Each page displays up to six decks.

A special message is displayed to the user if there are no decks to be shown whatsoever.

# Create
This page can be accessed by logged in users. Users are presented with a form for creating a deck. They can provide a title, a description (optional), and each flashcard that they want.

The user can switch between the title/description fields and flashcards section via the two tabs in the upper part of the page. Users can then add and remove flashcards, as well as switch through them via arrow buttons. For viewport widths of > 768px, both the front and back side forms will be displayed. For smaller viewports, the user can instead switch between the different sides with another set of tab buttons on the upper area of the page.

Creating a deck successfully results in the user being redirected to that deck's page. If there are validation errors, the user will be taken to the appropriate section.

## Search
This page can be accessed by pressing "Enter" on the menu's search field (as long as the field is not empty). The search page displays all decks whose titles contain the user's input. The search is case insensitive.

## Own
This page can be accessed by logged in users. It displays all decks created by the user.

## Details
This page displays details about a deck (title, description, creation date, update date if there is such) and allows the user to interact with it in various ways.

Clicking the "Start studying" button will start a study session. Users then can click a card to flip it. Clicking the arrow buttons allows the user to switch to the next/previous flashcard. If a flashcard is flipped when a button is clicked, the page will flip it back to the front side.

In addition, logged in users that are not the creators of the deck can bookmark/unbookmark the deck. Creators of the deck can access the edit page or delete the deck from this page.

All users can preview the list of cards in the deck. This is done by clicking the "Open list of flashcards" button. Clicking it afterwards will close the list.
