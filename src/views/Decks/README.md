# Deck pages

## Details
This page displays details about a deck (title, description, creation date, update date if there is such) and allows the user to interact with it in various ways.

Clicking the "Start studying" button will start a study session. Users then can click a card to flip it. Clicking the arrow buttons allows the user to switch to the next/previous flashcard. If a flashcard is flipped when a button is clicked, the page will flip it back to the front side.

In addition, logged in users that are not the creators of the deck can bookmark/unbookmark the deck. Creators of the deck can access the edit page or delete the deck from this page.

All users can preview the list of cards in the deck. This is done by clicking the "Open list of flashcards" button. Clicking it afterwards will close the list.
