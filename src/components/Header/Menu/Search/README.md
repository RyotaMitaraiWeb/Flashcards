# SearchField

## Usage
```vue
<SearchField></SearchField>
```

Renders a ``v-text-field`` (wrapped by a ``<form>`` tag) which is to be used within the navigation drawer menu. Submitting the form with a non-empty value will result in the user being redirected to the ``/decks/search`` page, setting the query param ``title`` to the user's input.

The component also comes with an inner ``mdi-magnify`` icon.
