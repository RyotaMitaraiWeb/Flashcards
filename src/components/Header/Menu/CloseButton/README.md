# CloseButton

## Usage

```vue
<CloseButton></CloseButton>
```

Renders a button which is to be used within the navigation drawer menu. Clicking it will dispatch the `close` action of the menu store, which effectively closes the menu.

The button is also rendered with a "close" Material Design icon and a `value` of `"close"` (for the purposes of Vuetify's `v-item-list` selection).
